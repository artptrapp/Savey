# Savey

Savey is the lightest and simplest cloud storage app out there! It is built using Ionic 4 with Angular and Firebase.

## Installation

You can install the dependencies with Yarn or NPM. It's up to you, really!

```bash
yarn install
```
OR
```bash
npm install
```

## Running

There are plenty of ways to run an Ionic application. However, since Savey uses native specific plugins, you will need to run it on a mobile device with USB Debugging enabled, or in a emulator, like:
```bash
ionic cordova run android -l
```

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

There are some things that I want to implement, and I would definitely appreciate help with them. Here are some:

- Unit tests everywhere
- Possibility to share a file with another person, maybe with a shareable link
- Organize file by folders
- Filter files by name, extension, or date of creation

Savey aims to be very lightweight, so please be careful when installing dependencies.
